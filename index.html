    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am a senior writer at South West News Service in Bristol, working on three national women's monthly magazines and one national women's weekly magazine. 
        I completed a Bachelor of Journalism at Rhodes University in South Africa in 2010, during which I worked as an intern reporter at three local newspapers. 
        After graduating, I completed a 10-month internship with Independent Newspapers, and was hired by one of the company's papers, The Daily News, in November 2011. 
        I then moved to the UK in November 2013. I worked as a part-time sales associate in Weston-Super-Mare for two years while I completed a Professional Diploma in 
        Digital Marketing.
